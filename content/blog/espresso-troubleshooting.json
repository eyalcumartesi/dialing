  "content": "<h2>The Three Most Common Problems</h2><p>Almost all espresso issues fall into three categories: sour (under-extracted), bitter (over-extracted), or weak/watery. Let's fix each one.</p><h2>Problem 1: Sour Espresso</h2><h3>What It Means</h3><p>Sour, tart, or acidic shots indicate <strong>under-extraction</strong>. Not enough flavor compounds have been dissolved from the coffee grounds.</p><h3>Quick Fixes</h3><ol><li><strong>Grind finer</strong>: This is usually the culprit. Go 1-2 steps finer on your grinder.</li><li><strong>Increase dose</strong>: Add 0.5-1g more coffee to your basket.</li><li><strong>Raise temperature</strong>: If your machine has temperature control, increase by 1-2°C.</li><li><strong>Extend brew time</strong>: Aim for 25-30 seconds instead of 20-25.</li></ol><h3>Check These Too</h3><ul><li><strong>Bean freshness</strong>: Beans less than 5 days post-roast can be difficult to extract. Wait a few more days.</li><li><strong>Roast level</strong>: Very light roasts are harder to extract and may always taste slightly sour. This might be intentional.</li><li><strong>Water temperature</strong>: Make sure your machine is fully warmed up.</li></ul><h2>Problem 2: Bitter Espresso</h2><h3>What It Means</h3><p>Harsh, bitter, or astringent shots indicate <strong>over-extraction</strong>. Too many bitter compounds have been extracted from the coffee.</p><h3>Quick Fixes</h3><ol><li><strong>Grind coarser</strong>: Go 1-2 steps coarser on your grinder.</li><li><strong>Decrease dose</strong>: Reduce by 0.5-1g.</li><li><strong>Lower temperature</strong>: Decrease by 1-2°C if possible.</li><li><strong>Shorten brew time</strong>: Aim for 20-25 seconds instead of 25-30.</li></ol><h3>Check These Too</h3><ul><li><strong>Stale beans</strong>: Beans older than 4-6 weeks can taste flat and bitter.</li><li><strong>Dark roast</strong>: Very dark roasts are easier to over-extract. Use cooler temps.</li><li><strong>Dirty equipment</strong>: Old coffee oils can add rancid bitterness. Clean your machine!</li><li><strong>Channeling</strong>: Uneven extraction can cause both sour and bitter notes.</li></ul><h2>Problem 3: Weak/Watery Espresso</h2><h3>What It Means</h3><p>Thin body, lack of flavor intensity, watery texture. Usually means water is flowing too fast.</p><h3>Quick Fixes</h3><ol><li><strong>Grind much finer</strong>: This is almost always the issue. Go 3-5 steps finer.</li><li><strong>Increase dose</strong>: More coffee creates more resistance.</li><li><strong>Check your basket</strong>: Pressurized baskets can cause weak shots. Upgrade to precision basket.</li><li><strong>Pre-infusion</strong>: If your machine has it, enable pre-infusion for better saturation.</li></ol><h3>Check These Too</h3><ul><li><strong>Brew time under 20 seconds</strong>: Way too fast. Grind finer immediately.</li><li><strong>Tamping pressure</strong>: Make sure you're tamping with consistent 30lb pressure.</li><li><strong>Distribution</strong>: Uneven coffee distribution can cause channels (water shortcuts).</li></ul><h2>Problem 4: Channeling</h2><h3>What It Means</h3><p>Water finds the path of least resistance, creating channels through the puck. Results in uneven extraction (sour AND bitter at the same time).</p><h3>How to Spot It</h3><ul><li>Spurts or jets in your bottomless portafilter</li><li>Very fast flow in certain spots</li><li>Blonde spots appearing early in the shot</li><li>Inconsistent shots (good one time, bad the next)</li></ul><h3>Solutions</h3><ol><li><strong>WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique)</strong>: Use a thin needle to break up clumps before tamping.</li><li><strong>Consistent tamping</strong>: Tamp level with even pressure every time.</li><li><strong>Fresh beans</strong>: Super fresh (&lt;3 days) or very stale beans clump more.</li><li><strong>Better basket</strong>: IMS or VST precision baskets help reduce channeling.</li><li><strong>Proper dosing</strong>: Don't overfill or underfill your basket.</li></ol><h2>Problem 5: Inconsistent Shots</h2><h3>What It Means</h3><p>Some shots are great, others are terrible, with no obvious changes.</p><h3>Solutions</h3><ol><li><strong>Weigh everything</strong>: Use a scale for dose in and yield out. Consistency requires precision.</li><li><strong>Temperature surfing</strong>: If no PID, follow the same routine every time.</li><li><strong>Workflow consistency</strong>: Time from grinding to extraction affects the shot. Keep it consistent.</li><li><strong>Check grinder retention</strong>: Old grounds mixing with fresh can cause issues. Purge grinder.</li></ol><h2>The Systematic Approach</h2><p>When troubleshooting, follow this priority order:</p><ol><li><strong>Grind size</strong>: Adjust first (biggest impact)</li><li><strong>Dose</strong>: Fine-tune second</li><li><strong>Temperature</strong>: Adjust third (if possible)</li><li><strong>Everything else</strong>: Distribution, tamping, etc.</li></ol><blockquote>Change ONE variable at a time! Otherwise you won't know what fixed (or broke) your shot.</blockquote><h2>Use Our Calculator</h2><p>Skip the trial and error.
